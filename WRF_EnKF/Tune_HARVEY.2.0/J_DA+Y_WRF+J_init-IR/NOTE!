Background: after going through the first phase of reproducing Zhang 2021'work using the exactly same tools + initial conditions + boundary conditions, the result looks promising even with uncertainties that comes from the use of a different cluster + different version of intel compiler.

Goal: replace WRF version from 3.6.1 to 4.1.2, see if IR+MW method still beats IR-only method.

Modifications to bash scripts:
******************************************
- Add force_use_old_data = .true. To &time_control section in namelist_real.sh/namelist_wrf_realtime.sh/namelist_wrf.sh   

- Add hybrid_opt = 0 To &dynamics section in namelist_real.sh/namelist_wrf_realtime.sh/namelist_wrf.sh
- Add use_theta_m = 0 To &dynamics section in namelist_real.sh/namelist_wrf_realtime.sh/namelist_wrf.sh

Modifications to EnKF code:
******************************************
Context: The current project uses initial conditions of v3.6.1 as input while WRF v4.1.2 is being used as NWP. Since v4.0, the moist theta temperature option is introduced. Two variables can be found from wrfout since v4.0: T and THM. T is the perturbation potential temperature theta-t0 and THM is either 1) pert moist pot temp=(1+Rv/Rd Qv)*(theta)-T0, or 2) pert dry pot temp=t. Under the condition use_theta_m = 0, WRF is supposed to use dry theta in dynamics. In this case, THM and T are the same, and both are perturbation dry potential temperature. However, T is a diagnostic variable while THM is a prognosic variable so we'd like to use THM variable in the WRF-EnKF system.

- Get a new copy of EnKF code; Change T in namelist_enkf.sh and EnKF code to THM.

Modification to Jerry's initial conditions
