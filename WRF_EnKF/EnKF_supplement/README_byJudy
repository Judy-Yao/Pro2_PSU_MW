Yunji Zhang utilized EnKF from two sources to implement and finish the first IR+MW PSU-EnKF experiment for Harvey in 2021 Fall:
- Major part: PSU-EnKF_w_satellites/fortran_src/EnSRF/src --> enkf.mpi
- Minor part: his own version of EnKF which is lcoated at Stampede2
Note: Most of the two are the same except 1. Zhang's version namelist is different from PSU-EnKF_w_satellites/fortran_src/EnSRF/ 2. PSU-EnKF_w_satellites/fortran_src/EnSRF/ only generates binary file (enkf.mpi) while Zhang's version generates other binanry files which are needed if the experiment is run using Zhangs'shell script

Judy Yao's goal (2022 Summer to Fall) is to demonstrate the IR+MW DA works in a statistical sense with a bulk study.
The first task is to reproduce the Harvey run before implements the method for other 2017 season hurricanes. 
For the DA part, procedures are:
1. compile PSU-EnKF_w_satellites/fortran_src/EnSRF/src (enkf.mpi generated)
2. compile the source code in this directory, and
3. link all of generated binary files to PSU-EnKF_w_satellites/fortran_src/EnSRF/src
